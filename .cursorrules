# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- Use poetry to run tests or anything python related.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Use Ruff for linting and formatting Python code as it's faster and more comprehensive than flake8/black
- Set up pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before committing changes
- Create shell scripts for common development tasks to improve workflow efficiency
- Document code quality practices in a separate file for better onboarding
- Address linting issues incrementally, starting with auto-fixable ones
- Pay attention to SQLAlchemy and Pydantic deprecation warnings to future-proof the codebase
- The simpler the implementation, the better
- Always develop a module and add the tests just after. Don't add several modules that can be filled with errors
- When implementing API endpoints, ensure all URLs have trailing slashes for consistency
- When creating new API endpoints, make sure to update the main.py file to include the new router
- Strive for simplicity first - implement only what's necessary and avoid feature creep

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When running tests, make sure PYTHONPATH includes the source directory to resolve imports correctly
- Even with correct poetry package configuration (packages = [{include = "package", from="src"}]), tests may need PYTHONPATH to include the project root to find the package
- When creating architectural plans, always include testing strategy and iterative development approach with feedback cycles
- Break down large documentation into separate files for better organization and easier reference
- In SQLAlchemy, joinedload is imported from sqlalchemy.orm and not a method of the Session object. Always import it separately: from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload
- When writing APIs that return related objects, use joinedload to eagerly load relationships to avoid N+1 query issues and ensure related objects are included in responses
- When writing test scripts for API endpoints, make sure to use the correct API routes with proper prefixes (e.g., '/api/tournaments/' instead of '/tournaments/')
- Include status checks in test scripts to ensure proper error handling and debugging
- When implementing new features, ensure all required API endpoints are created and properly registered in the main application
- When creating schemas that require relationships, make sure to include the foreign key fields in both the model and schema

Current milestone completed: Goal tracking functionality ✅
Next tasks to implement:
1. ✅ First implement the Goal model and related functionality - COMPLETED
2. Next, build player statistics tracking on top of goal data - IN PROGRESS
   - Create PlayerStats model to track player performance metrics
   - Implement calculation logic to update stats when goals are scored
   - Add API endpoints to retrieve individual and aggregated player statistics
3. Finally enhance team standings with additional statistics

Notes:
- The Goal model has been implemented and working correctly
- The Player API has been implemented to support player management
- The test script for goal tracking is working successfully and validating the functionality
- Next, we need to implement the PlayerStats model which will include fields like:
  - matches_played
  - goals_scored (derived from Goal records)
  - minutes_played
  - Additional stats like assists could be added in future iterations
- PlayerStats should be calculated and updated automatically when match results and goals are added
- Focusing on simplicity first - no report generation functionality needed
