# Development Approach

This document outlines the development approach for the Soccer Tournament Management System, including iterative MVP cycles and testing strategy.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Framework**: pytest
- **Coverage target**: 80%+ for core business logic
- **Mock external dependencies** (database, external APIs)
- **Test individual components** in isolation

### Integration Testing
- **Test API endpoints** with database interactions
- **Validate core workflows** across components
- **Use test fixtures** for database setup/teardown

### CI/CD Integration
- **Run tests** on every pull request
- **Block merges** that fail tests or reduce coverage
- **Generate coverage reports**

## Iterative MVP Approach

Rather than building the entire system in sequential phases, we'll use an iterative approach with clearly defined MVPs:

### MVP 1: Tournament and Team Structure (Week 1-2)
- Basic tournament creation and setup
- Team management
- Group creation and team assignment
- Simple API endpoints for core entities
- Unit tests for core functionality

**Feedback Cycle**: Review with stakeholders, adjust data model if needed

### MVP 2: Match Management (Week 3-4)
- Match scheduling
- Score recording
- Basic standings calculation
- Simple match calendar view
- Tests for match and standings logic

**Feedback Cycle**: User testing with simplified UI, gather feedback on usability

### MVP 3: Statistics and Reporting (Week 5-6)
- Player statistics
- Team statistics
- Exportable reports
- Expanded API endpoints
- Test suite expansion

**Feedback Cycle**: Review statistics accuracy, refine calculations based on feedback

### MVP 4: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)
- Phase progression rules
- Tournament templates
- Automatic scheduling
- Improved UI/UX
- Complete test coverage

**Feedback Cycle**: Full UAT with stakeholders, performance testing

### MVP 5: Refinement and Polish (Week 9-10)
- Performance optimizations
- UX improvements
- Bug fixes and edge cases
- Comprehensive documentation
- Final test suite review

## Development Workflow

Each MVP iteration will include:

1. **Planning and specification**
   - Define requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Create technical design documents
   - Estimate effort

2. **Implementation**
   - Develop backend features
   - Create or update API endpoints
   - Implement business logic

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests
   - Conduct integration testing
   - Perform manual testing

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run regression tests
   - Verify functionality

5. **Feedback collection**
   - Demo to stakeholders
   - Collect and document feedback
   - Prioritize issues and enhancement requests

6. **Iteration planning**
   - Update requirements based on feedback
   - Refine backlog for next MVP
   - Begin next iteration
